Standardization of Ports
We will be using following ports for running our microservices and components. Copy them and have them handy as we go further in the course!



1. Limits Microservice
Ports: 8080, 8081, etc.

2. Spring Cloud Config Server
Port: 8888

3. Currency Exchange Microservice
Ports: 8000, 8001, 8002, etc.

4. Currency Conversion Microservice
Ports: 8100, 8101, 8102, etc.

5. Netflix Eureka Naming Server
Port: 8761

6. API Gateway
Port: 8765

7. Zipkin Distributed Tracing Server

Adhering to these standards ensures smooth interaction and avoids conflicts in a distributed system.
